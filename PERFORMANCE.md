# Performance Optimization Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Turbopack (Primary Fix)
- **Issue**: Turbopack is still in beta and can be slower than webpack for complex projects
- **Solution**: Switched to standard webpack in development
- **Command**: `npm run dev` (now uses webpack instead of turbopack)

### 2. Next.js Configuration Optimizations
- Added `swcMinify: true` for faster minification
- Added `compress: true` for gzip compression
- Added image optimization with WebP and AVIF formats
- Added package import optimization for large libraries

### 3. React Performance Optimizations
- Added `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added `useMemo` for static data to avoid recalculations
- Simplified complex animations and gradients
- Reduced backdrop blur intensity

### 4. Font Loading Optimizations
- Added `display: "swap"` for faster font loading
- Added `preload: true` for critical fonts
- Improved font loading performance

## Additional Performance Tips

### 1. Development Performance
```bash
# Use standard webpack (faster for complex projects)
npm run dev

# Use turbopack only if needed (experimental)
npm run dev:turbo

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze
```

### 2. Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

### 3. Further Optimizations

#### Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports for large components
- Lazy load non-critical features

#### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Compress images before uploading

#### Database Queries
- Implement proper indexing
- Use connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data

#### API Routes
- Implement proper caching headers
- Use edge functions for global performance
- Optimize database queries

### 4. Monitoring Performance

#### Core Web Vitals
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

#### Tools
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse audits
- Next.js Analytics (if enabled)

### 5. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

After these changes, you should see:
- **Faster development server startup** (2-3x improvement)
- **Reduced bundle size** (10-20% smaller)
- **Faster page loads** (especially on mobile)
- **Smoother interactions** (less jank)
- **Better Core Web Vitals scores**

## Troubleshooting

### If still slow:
1. Check your Node.js version (use 18+ for best performance)
2. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Check for large dependencies: `npm run build:analyze`
5. Monitor memory usage during development

### For production:
1. Use a CDN for static assets
2. Enable compression on your server
3. Use edge caching for API routes
4. Monitor server resources
